  <b>How the web works</b><br><br>
Essentially, the World Wide Web is a network that connects computers with servers.<br>
The computers "talk" to servers by sending something called HTTP requests(Hypertext Transfer Protocol requests).<br><br>
<b>HTML</b><br><br>
HTML or Hyypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.<br>
It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets.<br><br>
<b>Tags and Elements</b><br><br>
An HTML tag is always contained within angled brakets.  Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag.  Void tags do not require closing tags.<br>
An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br><br>
<b>Inline vs. Block elements</b><br><br>
Inline elements format everything in a single line.  Examples are: br (break), em (embolden), and img (image). <br>
Block elements formats the contents within an invisible textbox.  Examples are: p (paragraph) and div (divide).<br><br>
<b>Computers are <i>smart</i>: People are <i>stupid</i>!</b><br><br>
Unlike humans, computers follow instructions <i>exactly</i> as they are given and so long as the “syntax” is correct they will do exactly what they are told.  Humans, on the other hand, not so much.
